            Built an agricultural data validation and imputation engine 
            to power the monetization of sustainable agriculture. 
            Developed validation and imputation methodologies to 
            support the measuring, reporting, and verification of 
            farming activity (XX fields, XX acres). Worked with soil 
            scientists, data scientists, and product owners / managers 
            to integrate software in a pipeline that generates 
            verified carbon credits from organic carbon sequestered in 
            agricultural soils. Carbon program achieved 
            XX and XX year-over-year growth in its second 
            and third credit issuances with monotonically increasing conversion 
            rates. This work resulted in

        \item {
            Acted as tech-/team- lead on a fledgling squad that led 
            the development of the carbon credit generation pipeline.
            Worked with squad to define intermediate and short-term
            work planning processes that suited the fast-paced MVP
            development required for a scrappy new product.

            Mentored junior engineers and guided career growth, overseeing XX promotions to senior and staff engineer.
        }
        \item {
            Improved, documented, and maintained a distributed service 
            that summarizes remote sensing observations over field
            geometries. Service scales elastically to meet bursty
            loads, processing jobs with variable, high concurrency.
        }
        \item {
            Designed and built a system to perform pairwise comparisons
            between thousands of bacterial genomes (>3M comparisons)
            using a map-reduce framework. Corpus of similarity 
            scores were used by data scientists as features in ML 
            models to guide the design of symbiotic bacterial seed 
            coatings that are sold as sustainable "biological" 
            alternatives to traditional farming inputs.

        \item {
            Developed a neural network-based classifier that detected
            precipitation in nearly real time using cellular data link attenuation
            time series. Gathered and cleaned historical ground truth 
            data from weather stations to train production models.
        }
        \item {
            Built a feature generation and prediction pipeline that integrated
            with the cellular link time series ingest pipeline in production,
            publishing low-latency precipitation inferences at tens of thousands
            of locations.

            Took a course in scientific communication led by
            experts from the Boston Museum of Science focused on
            effective oral, written, and visual communication.
            The course focused on communicating complex topics
            to diverse audiences. Received conference awards for oral (research talk) and written/visual (poster) communication.
